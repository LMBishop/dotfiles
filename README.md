# dotfiles

Dotfiles for my machines. While I don't recommend using them (since everybody has highly specific needs), you're welcome to look around.

## Usage

For fast installation, I wrote a small script to copy the dotfiles to their destinations. The files and the manner in which they should be copied is specified in the `directoryinfo` file.

To use this script, simply run:
```
$ ./deploy.py
```
