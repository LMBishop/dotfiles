# dotfiles

Dotfiles for my machines. While I don't recommend using them (since everybody has highly specific needs), you're welcome to look around.

## Usage

For fast installation, I wrote a small script to copy the dotfiles to their destinations. 

The script also installs some utilities that I use. This is all defined in `info.yml`.

To use this script, simply run:
```
$ ./deploy.py
```
